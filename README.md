# hello-world
Hey Yall, Ghost Repotin'

So, you found my GitHub. That's cool. This is just somewhere for me to save files, and maybe mess around a little.

At any time, you might stumble across random text files, backups of Pyton or Arduino code, archives of gods know what, and many other things.

So please, by all means, come, sit, spend some time poking arround in the depths of my hapahazardly organized file structure. 
Try not to get lost, and don't mind the skeleton in the corner. Her name's Remi, and I promise she won't bite.
